            It's me Robert. I graduated from mechatronics engineering. But I
            specialize in Front End Web Dev as I am always looking forward to
            expanding my knowledge. Along the way I've learned a lot of
            different technologies to satisfy my curiosity and be able to use
            suitable techniques for certain projects.
